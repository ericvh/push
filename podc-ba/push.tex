%maybe lead in with something different
The deluge of huge data sets such those provided by sensor networks, 
online transactions, and the web provide exciting opportunities for data
analytics.  The scale of the data makes it impossible to deal with in a
reasonable amount of time on isolated machines~\cite{barroso2003wsp}.
This has lead to Data Intensive Supercomputing~\cite{bryant2007dis} emerging
as the standard tool for solving research problems using these vast datasets.
In typical DISC systems, 
runtimes ~\cite{dean2008msd}~\cite{bialecki:hfr}~\cite{isard2007ddd} define 
graphs of processes, the edges of the graphs representing 
pipes and their vertices represent computation on a system.  
Within these runtimes a new class of 
languages~\cite{pike2005idp}~\cite{yu2008dsg}~\cite{olston2008pln} 
can be used by researchers to solve "pleasantly parallel" 
problems more quickly without worrying about explicit concurrency.

These languages provide automated control flow(typically matched to the 
architecture of the underlying runtime) and channels of communication between 
systems.
In existing systems, these workflows and the underlying computation are 
tightly linked, tying solutions to a particular runtime, workflow and language.
This creates difficulties for analytics researchers who wish to draw upon
tools written in many different languages or runtimes which may be available
on several different architectures or operating systems.

We observe that UNIX pipes~\cite{mcilroy1964paf} were designed to get around 
many of these incompatibilities, allowing developers to hook together tools 
written in different languages and runtimes in ad-hoc fashions.  
This allowed tool developers to focus on doing one thing well, and
enabled code portability and reuse in ways not originally conceived by
the tool authors.  The UNIX shell incorporated a model for tersely composing 
these smaller tools in pipelines (e.g. 'sort $|$ uniq -c'),  
creating coherent workflow to solve more complicated problems 
quickly. 
Tools read from standard input and wrote to standard output, allowing programs 
to work together in streams \emph{with no explict knowledge of this chaining
built into the program itself}.

% REWORK to contrasting problems of DISC with UNIX pipelines
One to one pipelines such as those used by a typical UNIX shell, can not be 
trivially mapped to DISC workflows which incorporate one-to-many, many-to-many,
and many-to-one data flows. 
Futhermore, typical UNIX pipeline tools write data according to buffer 
boundaries instead of record boundaries any attempts to distribute buffered 
data unmodified from a pipe will fail---the system will fail to notice XML 
element boundaries or newlines in line based records. 
As \cite{pike2005idp} notes DISC systems need to be able to cleanly separate 
input streams into records and then show that the order of these records is 
independent. 
By separating input and output into discrete unordered records data can be 
easily distributed and coalesced.

To address these issues we have implemented a prototype shell, 
which we call PUSH, using DISC principles and incorporating extended 
pipeline operators to establish distributed workflows and correlate results.
Our implementation is based on extending an existing shell, MASH\cite{mashman}, 
from which we inherited a rich interpreted scripting language. 
It treats variables as lists of strings and has no native handling for any 
other data type. 
Integer expression handling and other facilities are provided by shell commands. 
It has native regular expression support and it has a novel ability to do 
declarative shell programming through a make like syntax incorporated in the 
shell itself.

This data is first "Fanned out" to multiple pipes by a multiplexor and then it is subsequently "Fanned in" by a de-multiplexor}\label{fig:pipestruct} 
\end{figure}

We have added two additional pipeline operators, 
a multiplexing fan-out(\verb!|<![n]), and a coalescing fan-in(\verb!>|!). 
This combination allows PUSH to distribute I/O to and from multiple
simultaneous threads of control.
The fan-out argument \emph{n} specifies the desired degree of parallel 
threading.  If no argument is specified, the default of spawning a new
thread per record (up to the limit of available cores) is used.  This can
also be overriden by command line options or environment variables.
The pipeline operators provide implicit grouping semantics allowing natural 
nesting and composability.
While their complimentary nature usually lead to a symmetric
mappings (where the number of fan-outs equal the number of fan-ins), there is 
nothing within our implementation which enforces it.
Normal redirections as well as application specific sources and sinks 
can provide alternate data paths.
Remote thread distribution and interconnect are composed and managed
using synthetic file systems in much the same manner as Xcpu~\cite{xcpu}, 
pushing the distributed complexity into the middleware in an language and 
runtime independent fashion.

PUSH also differs from traditional shells by implementing native support for 
records based input handling over pipelines. This facility is similar to the 
argument field separators, IFS and OFS, in traditional shells which use a 
pattern to determine how to tokenize arguments. PUSH provides two variables, 
ORS and IRS, which point to record separator modules. These modules 
(called multiplexors in PUSH) split data on record boundaries, emitting 
individual records that the system distributes and coalesces. 

The choice of which multipipe to target is left as a decision to the module. 
Different data formats may have different output requirements. 
Demultiplexing from a multipipe is performed by creating a many to one 
communications channel within the shell. The shell creates a reader processes 
which connect to each pipe in the multipipe. When the data reaches an 
appropriate record boundary a buffer is passed from the reader to the shell 
which then writes each record buffer to the output pipeline. 

An example from our particular experience, Natural Language Processing, is 
to apply an analyzer to a large set of files, a "corpus". User programs go 
through each file which contain a list of sentences, one sentence per line. 
They then tokenize the sentence into words, finding the part of speech and 
morphology of the words that make up the sentence.

This sort of task maps very well to the DISC model. There are a large number of 
discrete sets of data whose order is not necessarily important. We need to 
perform a computationally intensive task on each of the sentences, which are 
small, discrete records and ideal target for parallelization. 

PUSH was designed to exploit this mapping. For example, to get a histogram of 
the distribution of Japanese words from a set of documents using chasen, 
a Japanese morphological analyzer, we take a set of files containing sentences 
and then distribute them to a cluster of machines on our network. The command 
is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
push -c '{
ORS=./blm.dis
du -an files |< xargs os chasen | awk '{print \$1}' | sort | uniq -c >|
sort -rn
}'
\end{verbatim}

The first variable, ORS, declares our record multiplexor module, the intermediary 
used to ensure that the input and output to distributed pipes are correctly 
aligned to record boundaries. du -n gives a list of the files (note that our 
du is a bit different from the canonical UNIX du, it replaces much of find's 
functionality) which are then "fanned out"(\verb!|<!) using a combination 
of a \emph{multipipe}, an ordered set of pipes, and a \emph{multiplexors} 
which determines which pipes are the targets of each unit of output.  
This fanned out data goes to xargs on other machines which 
then uses the filenames(sent from the intantiating machine) as arguments to 
chasen. The du acts as a command driver, fanning out file names to the 
individual worker machines. The workers then use the filenames input to 
xargs, which uses the input filenames as arguments to xargs target command. 
Using the output of the analyzer awk extracts the first line fields(Japanese 
words) which are then sorted and counted using uniq.  Finally these word 
counts are "fanned in"(\verb!>|!) to the originating machine which then 
sorts them. 

% status and future work
Because PUSH distributes streaming data over potentially remote links push 
is prone to causing network congestion between nodes. Tools that better 
preserve data locality like Plan 9's cfs(a caching user level filesystem) 
and a distributed databases similar to Google's Bigtable\cite{chang2006bds} 
manipulated by queries over multipipes would better preserve the locality of data. 

% need more here summarizing existing performance data, status, and code
location.

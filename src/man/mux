Mux is a way of filtering multiple inputs into a system. 
you initiatly. 

you give it a number of inputs and outputs and it multiplexes between them. 
it tells you which of those to do. 

to create a multiplexer you give it multiple inputs. To create a demultiplexer you give it multiple outputs. 

You dictate how many inputs and outputs in the start function.

you also define the multiplexer so it can do what you want in terms of the fan out procedure. 

It doesn't dictate how you deal with file descriptors.
